# Hangman-Game

A guessing word game implemented in Java. 

The program first randomly chooses a word from the dictionary. Each time, the player guesses one letter that maybe in the chosen word. The program responds whether it is included or not. If the letter exists in the word, it still shows the position of this letter. The player needs to figure out the word in a fixed number (default value is 6) of guesses. In the end, it will declare the result of the game and ask the player whether to play another round.
